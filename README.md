# Geometric Interpretation of the Riemann Zeta Function: ζ(2), ζ(3), and ζ(6)

Stumbled upon this geometric interpretation of the zeta function I haven't seen before.

## Geometric Setup

Consider a unit circle divided into \(n\) equal segments, where \(n\) ranges from 1 to infinity. For each segment, we compare the **arc length**, given by \( \frac{2\pi}{n} \), and the **chord length**, given by \( 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \). As \(n\) increases, the segment angle decreases, and the difference between the arc length and the chord length becomes small. This difference can be approximated using the Taylor series expansion of \(\sin(x)\) around 0.

### Chord and Arc Lengths

To formalize this, let's first compute the lengths geometrically. Consider a unit circle with a central angle \(\theta\) (in radians). The **arc length** \(s\) subtended by this angle is:

\[
s = \theta
\]

The **chord length** \(c\) subtended by the same angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
c = 2 \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

For small angles \(\theta\), we use the Taylor series expansion for \(\sin(x)\):

\[
\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5)
\]

Thus, for small \(\theta\):

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \approx \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^3}{6} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta^3}{48}
\]

So the chord length \(c\) becomes:

\[
c = 2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta^3}{48} \right) = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{24}
\]

### Difference Between Arc Length and Chord Length

The difference between the arc length and the chord length is:

\[
s - c = \theta - \left(\theta - \frac{\theta^3}{24}\right) = \frac{\theta^3}{24}
\]

Now, if we divide the unit circle into \(n\) equal segments, each segment subtends an angle \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{n}\). The difference for each segment is then:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)^3}{24} = \frac{8\pi^3}{24n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}
\]

### Sum of the Differences for ζ(3)

Summing this difference over all segments as \(n \to \infty\) gives us the geometric interpretation of ζ(3):

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}\right) = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \zeta(3)
\]

This suggests that ζ(3), Apéry's constant, represents the **total error** when comparing the arc length to the chord length for **each individual slice** of the circle.

## Geometric Interpretation of ζ(2)

For ζ(2), we shift focus from the individual slices to the **entire whole**. Instead of comparing the arc and chord lengths for each segment, we now compare the **perimeter** of an \(n\)-sided polygon to the **circumference** of the circle. The perimeter of the polygon approximates the circle, but there's always a small error due to the curvature of the circle.

As \(n\) increases, the polygon gets closer to the circle, but this error still accumulates globally. The sum of these errors across all subdivisions can be captured by the series \(\sum \frac{1}{n^2}\), which leads to:

\[
\zeta(2) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
\]

Thus, **ζ(2)** reflects the total approximation error when comparing the entire polygon to the circle, focusing on the global shape.

## Extension to ζ(6)

The approach can be extended to higher orders, such as ζ(6), by examining more refined corrections in the arc-chord differences. Specifically, the sum of the **squared differences** between arc lengths and chord lengths tends to approach ζ(6) as \(n\) increases. Formally, we can describe it as:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{2\pi}{n} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right)^2 \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi^6}{9} \zeta(6)
\]

Here, ζ(6) captures even higher-order corrections between the arc and the chord lengths, and this is reflected in the series involving \(n^{-6}\) terms.
