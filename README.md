# Geometric Interpretation of the Riemann Zeta Function: ζ(2), ζ(3), and ζ(6)

Stumbled upon this geometric interpretation of the zeta function I haven't seen before.

 Consider a unit circle divided into (n) equal segments, with (n) ranging from 1 to infinity. For each segment, we examine the difference between the arc length, given by ( \frac{2\pi}{n} ), and the chord length, given by ( 2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{n}) ). As (n) increases, the segment angle decreases, and the difference between the arc length and the chord length can be approximated using the Taylor series expansion of (\sin(x)) around 0.
 
Chord and Arc Lengths

Consider a unit circle with a central angle (\theta) (in radians). The arc length (s) subtended by this angle is given by:
[ s = \theta ]
The corresponding chord length (c) is given by:
[ c = 2 \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) ]
For small angles (\theta), we can use the Taylor series expansion for (\sin(x)):
[ \sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5) ]
Thus, for small (\theta):
[ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \approx \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^3}{6} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta^3}{48} ]
So the chord length (c) becomes:
[ c = 2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta^3}{48} \right) = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{24} ]
Difference Between Arc Length and Chord Length

The difference between the arc length and the chord length is:
[ s - c = \theta - \left(\theta - \frac{\theta^3}{24}\right) = \frac{\theta^3}{24} ]
Now, if we divide the unit circle into (n) equal segments, each segment subtends an angle (\theta = \frac{2\pi}{n}). The difference for each segment is then:
[ \frac{\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)^3}{24} = \frac{8\pi^3}{24n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} ]

zeta 2: This error accumulates when you look at the whole perimeter of the polygon compared to the whole circumference of the circle.
Zeta 3: The error that you accumulate when you look at an individual component


## Extension to ζ(6)

The approach can be extended to higher orders, such as ζ(6), by examining more refined corrections in the arc-chord differences. Specifically, the sum of the **squared differences** between arc lengths and chord lengths tends to approach ζ(6) as \(n\) increases. Formally, we can describe it as:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{2\pi}{n} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right)^2 \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi^6}{9} \zeta(6)
\]

Here, ζ(6) captures even higher-order corrections between the arc and the chord lengths, and this is reflected in the series involving \(n^{-6}\) terms.
